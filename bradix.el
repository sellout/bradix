Bradix format uses Unicode braille code points as the radix point. It’s
interpreted in binary to determine the base. E.g., ⠌ = base 12 (in base 10).
A single arbitrary space character (although THIN SPACE is recommended) or comma
may be placed between each digit as a separator, but all of the separators must
use the same character. There can be a leading + or - (which also requires at
least one digit before the radix point, and for bases >10, A–Z are allowed,
case-insensitively. There can be an exponent, represented in the same base."
